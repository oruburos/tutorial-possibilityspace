This is an interactive tool to explore the idea of generative space and possibility space, two important topics in procedural generation. Mike Cook made it as part of a series called Possibility Space (somewhat confusingly).

# Current Version: 0.9
This is the initial commit of the project, based on a talk I gave at Goldsmiths in early 2017. I'm planning to overhaul this for a Possibilty Space video in the future.
